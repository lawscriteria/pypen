# PyPen

#### Description: PyPen is an open source Python project that enables the user to write on a window using their mouse. This is useful for taking notes without using any real pen and paper, thus saving the time, effort, and ink with just the press & hold of a mouse on a blank black window! This is incredibly useful when you're trying to illustrate an idea for a concept or just trying to solve some math problem - simple or hard.

### There are different *ink sizes*

## How to Use: 

1) #### Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. 
    [Click here to install Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Set Up: Once Python is installed, follow these steps:
    - #### Open your code editor or IDE
        If you do not have a code editor, you'll have to download one. Popular IDEs include [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). Install and open your code editor of preference.
    - #### Open the Project File
        Open the file *random_password_generator.py* within the *random_password_generator* folder you downloaded. Note that it is a *.zip* file, so you will need to extract it using a *zip file manager*.
    - #### Run the Python File
        Before you run the Python file, open the terminal of your code editor and type in the following command:
        
        <blockquote>pip install pygame</blockquote>
        
        This installs the *Pygame* module, which is used by this project, so you'll need to have it installed. After you have installed it, run the .py file.
